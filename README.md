# DeepLearning-SE4050-Project
Working on a supervised learning problem, four models were used to generate and compare the results.

*Programming Assignment - Introduction
You may apply Deep learning to solve any real-world problem based on any real-world dataset.
You may use a publicly available dataset from a source like the following one (you can choose any other data source. 
Be sure to cite where you got your data from. The dataset has to be real-world data that is published on the internet). 
Following are two example data sources for Deep Learning datasets.

Based on a dataset, you may develop a Deep learning algorithm and then get the test results. 
You may use Python as the programming language and Jupyter Notebook or any other IDE as the development environment.

Assignment Requirements

If you are working on a supervised learning problem, FOUR models may be used to generate and compare the results.
For unsupervised learning, THREE models may be used. For reinforcement learning problems, TWO models/algorithms may be used.
